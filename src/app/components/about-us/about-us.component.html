        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
          give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
          truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
          is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that
          are extremely painful.</p>
        <p>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
          because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
          trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from
          it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
          consequences.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
          by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
          that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness.</p>
        <p>It will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
          always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
          pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>
